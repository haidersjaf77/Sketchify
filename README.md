# Sketchify
# Image to Pencil Sketch Converter  

## Overview  
This project utilizes **Computer Vision techniques** to transform images into **pencil sketches** in real-time. Built with **Python, OpenCV, and Flask**, the application applies image processing operations to generate artistic sketch effects from user-uploaded images.  

## Features  
- **Grayscale Conversion & Edge Detection** to enhance sketch details.  
- **Gaussian Blurring & Image Blending** for a smooth pencil-drawn effect.  
- **Real-Time Image Processing** using Flask for an interactive web interface.  
- **Supports Multiple Image Formats** including JPEG and PNG.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** (OpenCV, NumPy, Flask)  
- **Computer Vision & Image Processing**  
- **Web-Based Interface** for user interaction  

## How to Run  
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python flask numpy
